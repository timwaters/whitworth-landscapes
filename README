Historical landscape paintings, mapped with flickr photos of landscape around the same area.

It uses clever internet wizardry (Yahoo's Placemaker) to parse out the locations from the titles of the paintings, and then put them on a map with the correct image. Improvements: Allow people to correct location of the scene. Written during Cuture Hack North 2011, Leeds, UK

Dev notes:

you need a Flickr API Key and a Yahoo App API Key

You'd need the painting images to use, put these in /public/images
